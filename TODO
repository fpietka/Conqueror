Board builder with premade boards

Turn:
- The current player choose one of his cells (C1)
- Then he choose a neighbour of C1 (C2)
- select a number of pawns to move to C2 (between 0 and the number of pawns on C1)
- if C2 is owned by another player, a fight occurs. The player having the highest number of pawns wins the fight.
	If both players have the same number of pawns, the fight is a draw, C2 owner does not change, no player lose pawns
	If the current player wins the fight, C2 becomes his and the pawns he moved are based on C2.
	If the current player loses the fight, he loses the pawns he moved
- If the current player wins the fight and if he owns all the cells or if all the other players
	are defeated, he wins the game.
